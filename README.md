This is the HWBOT of PYPrime, it doesn't require for python to be installed.
To submit the benchmark result you have to upload Submission.hwbot to the submission page for PYPrime.
This version, for obvious reasons is not open source, the standard etidition is though.

In case anyone was interested this is the naming scheme for all future versions of hwbot
for example

1.4.1 HWBOT		HWBOT version of the benchmark, first revision of the submission file structure
1.4 CLI			Standard version of the benchmark, 4th update of the featureset, requires Pyhton 
1.4 GUI			GUI version of the benchmark, requires python 
2.1 CLI			Standard version of the benchmark second revision of the algorythm, requires python. The results are not compatible with PYPrime 1.x.x versions of the benchmark
